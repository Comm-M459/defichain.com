      headline: The DeFiChain Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting DeFiChain ecosystem and related technologies as well as communities.
      subhead: The DeFiChain Foundation is not a for-profit company, or even a traditional non-profit. Their role is not to control or lead DeFiChain, nor are they the only organization that funds critical development of DeFiChain-related technologies. The DeFiChain Foundation is one part of a much larger ecosystem.
