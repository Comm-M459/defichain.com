Liquidity mining is a DeFi (decentralized finance) mechanism in which participants supply cryptocurrencies into liquidity pools, and being rewarded with fees and tokens based on their share of the total pool liquidity. Liquidity pools in DeFiChain consist of liquidity in pairs of coins, used by the DeFiChain DEX (Decentralized Exchange).

DeFiChain currently only support wrapped tokens, namely wrapped ETH, BTC and USDT.
If you also need DFI, you can watch our guide on where and how to buy DFI.
Method 1: Using the DEX The first method is right within the DeFi app.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Policy</title><link>https://defichain.com/privacy-policy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://defichain.com/privacy-policy/</guid><description>DEFICHAIN FOUNDATION LTD.

One thing to note is that in order to set up a masternode, you must have a minimum of 20,000 DFI.
NOTE: This how-to expects some basic familiarity with the Linux terminal
Masternode roles There are two distinct roles: &amp;lsquo;masternode owner&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;masternode operator&amp;rsquo;. The owner holds the collateral and the primary activity (minting new coins, voting for anchors) is performed by operator.</description></item><item><title>Security</title><link>https://defichain.com/security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://defichain.com/security/</guid><description>Audit 2: KnownSec Result PASS Number DeFiChain-GLSJ-20201020 Date October 20, 2020 Auditor Audit report Download Audit 1: Slow Mist Result PASS Number BCA002009180001 Date September 18, 2020 Auditor Audit report Download</description></item><item><title>Swap and arbitrage</title><link>https://defichain.com/learn/swap-and-arbitrage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://defichain.com/learn/swap-and-arbitrage/</guid><description>Swap using the DEX Swapping tokens on the DeFiChain DEX (Decentralized Exchange) is easy. At the time of writing, the DEX offers swap for the following pairs:
Ethereum–DeFiChain (ETH–DFI) Bitcoin–DeFiChain (BTC–DFI) Tether–DeFiChain (USDT–DFI) The DeFiChain DEX does not suffer the high gas fees of Ethereum-based DEX, due to network congestion. Afterall, Ethereum being a general purpose blockchain, isn&amp;rsquo;t specifically designed for decentralized finance. DeFiChain on the other hand, is born and made for DeFi, and DeFi only.</description></item><item><title>Wallet encryption</title><link>https://defichain.com/learn/wallet-encryption/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://defichain.com/learn/wallet-encryption/</guid><description>Notice: Encrypting your wallet via the console will cause your mnemonic phrase to change, do not rely on your mnemonic phrase as a backup if you follow this guide, instead make a backup after enabling encryption using backup files and store them in a secure location.
At the time of this writing, v2.1.4, the app does not yet have a graphical UI built-in to facilitate wallet encryption or locking. This can be a serious risk as your wallets can be compromised by any person or system having access to your wallet.</description></item><item><title>White paper</title><link>https://defichain.com/white-paper/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://defichain.com/white-paper/</guid><description>Abstract: The DeFiChain Foundation is developing DeFiChain, a blockchain specifically dedicated to decentralized financial applications.
